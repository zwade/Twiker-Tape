Things to do, 2013-2014

-CODE IS LOCATED AT: github.com/zwade/Twiker-Tape and on Rachel’s red USB


-Check glitches on board one (left, if ARDUINO is in top left corner)
-wire second board using MAXIM6968 daisy chain (DIN/DOUT) 
-things to check up on: make sure 21 IRF9520 MOSFETs are capable of handling rows for 8 displays (some math can be found on the back of handwritten sheet, Jan30, 2013)
-order parts including: 
	-24 LED displays 
	-21 IRF9520 MOSFETs
-15 6968MAXIM APE shift registers [(24 LED displays x 5 columns)/(8outputs                   each)]
	-mounting equipment 
	-wall power supply

plexiglass/ perfboards/ wood (?) 

ALSO, FOR THE FUTURE: 
-figure out how to get stuff off of the internet   (Zach says Ethernet shield)
